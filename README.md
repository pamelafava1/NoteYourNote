# NoteYourNote
The app manages notes lists where the user can write text (also via text 2 speech) and optionally an image and/or a vocal note. 
Each note/ToDo list will be geolocated, and it can be stored in the device or in the cloud. 
All the data can be saved on the firebase remote db after a login if the user logged in. Otherwise the data will be stored in the device.
